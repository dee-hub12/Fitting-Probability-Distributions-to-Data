# Fitting-Probability-Distributions-to-Data
Employed various probability distributions (both discrete and continuous) to analyze count data, with the primary objective of assessing the goodness-of-fit and to determine the suitability of the distributions for the data. 

Identified key characteristics including skewness, kurtosis, symmetry, and other relevant features to inform the analysis.
